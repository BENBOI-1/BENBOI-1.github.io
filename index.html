 pls label all of the code like i have done with some of it
 (and update the labels on existing ones)
 so that everyone knows whats actually going on


 Also, can we go for an ocean themed website?
 i think it would look pretty neat with lots of blue colours
 and oceany things (coral, fish, ect) AFTER WE DO THE CODING 
 because we are so far behind lol


 something is up with the black box that says "PIRATES" beacuse when 
 i load the website on my phone or thinkpad its sized differently,
 pls fix beacuse idk how it works. thx

 
 Pls leave anything you think should be here, here.

            Digital Piracy refers to the unauthorized duplication

            of copyrighted content that is sold at lower prices in the ‘grey’ market.

            Piracy has become more rampant because of the easy access of technology.

            Piracy also refers to the distribution and use of copyrighted materials,

            so, even if someone does not take part in the duplication process of piracy,

            simply distributing it or using it is a crime which may result in legal penalties.

            <br><br>
            
            Laws have been created to try to prevent piracy and protect copyrighted works and their privacy. 
            
            Despite this, the laws on piracy depend on the country: more developed countries have strict 
            
            laws for piracy, meanwhile countries with more pressing matters do not give piracy the attention 
            
            it needs. The IT and music industries are the most active industries involved in preventing piracy. 
            
            With the help of the police, raids on organizations that pirate are conducted. 
            
            Despite this, penalties are not harsh enough to eliminate the issue at all.
