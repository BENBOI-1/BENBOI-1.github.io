    <div class="content">
<h1 style="color: #ffffff; margin-top: 75px">Ethical reasons</h1>
<p style="margin-top: 20px; color: #ffffff;">
A main argument against piracy is that it disrespects the labour, 
time, and investment of the original creators of the content. Just like any other profession, 
artists, developers, and other content creators should be compensated for their work. 
A lot of people believe it’s unfair to benefit from someone else's content without compensation. 
Some also argue that piracy can disable creativity by reducing the motivation for creators to produce new content. 
If they aren’t being compensated for the work they put in, why should they put work in at all? 
In contrast, those who do pirate argue a number of reason as to why the do. For starters, 
the inaccessibility of music, games, movies, books and others is a major reason why people pirate. 
This can apply to content targeted towards teenagers, or people who do not generally have 
access to a steady income/financial freedom. 
People who find that content is physically unable to be accesed legaly because of
companies like nintendo removing all unlisensed content and
obselite tech that is almost impossible to obtain without large amounts of money find that piracy fixes the problem.
